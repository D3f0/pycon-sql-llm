### LLMs used for SQL generation

{.incremental}

Our research project aims to provide a flexible framework for SQL generation.
Our goal is to enable smaller models to perform in par with frontier models 
optimizing for accuracy and cost.

## Current OSS tooling

- ü¶ú ‚õìÔ∏è LangChain: [`QA over SQL data`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/)

::: fragment
```{python}
print(1)

## Pydantic AI 

2- PyDantic's AI [`SQL workbench`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/examples/sql-gen/)

## Common challenges

- Some databases have specific dialects, e.g. SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, db2, etc.
- The training set of the models may not have a sufficient examples 
  for the database engine we're interested in.
- Providing tables is great, but some times, schemas are quite big
  and the table and column names may be not human friendly.


---

## Pipelines

Our work was focused on prompt optimization by a small team, but as 
our teams tarted to grown we needed to allow different research team
to focus on different areas.

We created a framework inspired in LangGraph tailored to the text2sql 
generation.

## Engineering Challenges

Some

- Bird benchmarks
- Benchmarks frameworks
	- Unitxt
- Pipelines
- 
- Providing context 
	- 
- Shape of the context 
- Model sizes
	- Limits
