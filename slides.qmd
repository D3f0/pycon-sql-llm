## LLMs used for SQL generation

LLMs have been  capable of generating SQL from text questions for some time.
Models have been trained with large sets of queries enabling the generation of complex joins expressions, window functions with custom aggregation as well as breaking
down the problem into pieces using common table expressions.

---

## What is our goal

::: {.incremental}
- Develop and test new and existing SoTA techinques against public and proprietary datasets
  - Benchmarking (e.g. [unitxt](https://github.com/IBM/unitxt))
- Support multiple dialects (CSV, SQLite, Postgres, Presto, db2) 
- Multi tenancy in internal SaaS.
- Augmented **chat** interaction as well ass **api** access (both as SaaS ‚òÅÔ∏è and on-prem üè¢ deployments)
- Enable tool calling for *agentic* use cases
- Extensibility and auto-configuration based on benchmarks.
:::

<!-- ---

## Relevant challenges

::: {.incremental}
- üí¨ Chat interfaces are good for question input
- Providing the DB structure helps a lot to reduce hallucinations
- üßëüèΩ‚Äçüè´ showing examples to LLMs improves performance
- ü•¥ Models can hallucinate making up inexistent tables, columns or functions
- SQL dialects have their nuances (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL)

# Improving accuracy

## Schema linking

SL is an common improvement over in text to SQL generation to improve accuracy and reduce
hallucinations. It consists on mapping natural language words to `tables`, `views`, `columns` and `values`.

---

### Schema Liking Techniques

::: {.incremental}
- Prompt engineering
  - Providing `CREATE TABLE customers (name varchar...)`
- Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG
- Agentic approaches, function calling
  - `give_me_tables(user_input)`
- Fine tuned models
  - Provide SQL examples and their meaning
:::

### SL with RAG

TBD

## DSL for pipelines

    1[User input] --> 2[Find relevant tables]
    2 --> 3[Find relevant values]
    3 --> 4[Find relevant examples]
    4 --> 5[Create prompt using templating]
    5 --> 6[Call LLM, parse results]

## Pydantic AI 

2- PyDantic's AI [`SQL workbench`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/examples/sql-gen/)

---

## Common challenges

- Some databases have specific dialects, e.g. SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, db2, etc.
- The training set of the models may not have a sufficient examples 
  for the database engine we're interested in.
- Providing tables is great, but some times, schemas are quite big
  and the table and column names may be not human friendly.


---

## Pipelines

Our work was focused on prompt optimization by a small team, but as 
our teams tarted to grown we needed to allow different research team
to focus on different areas.

We created a framework inspired in LangGraph tailored to the text2sql 
generation.
